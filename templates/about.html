                <p>Hello guys! My name is Jose-Maria, I was born in 1988 in Spain but I am currently living and working in The Netherlands for more than four years.</p>
                <p>Since I was a child I feel attraction for science and technology so I perform MSc. in Chemical Engineering.
                    For many years I did programming as a hobby, but now it is my way of living. I am working as a developer for the pharmaceutical sector.</p>

                <p>By the way, my favourite languages are Python, C and C++. I hope you enjoy this blog a lot!</p>
